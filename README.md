# HackYoung Olympiad Project

Developed for the HackYoung Olympiad, this project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to visualize real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data from major global cities, focusing on its impact on public health. It seamlessly integrates with the World Air Quality Index Project's API (https://aqicn.org/api/) to fetch and process AQI data, ensuring compliance with attribution guidelines. The data is dynamically presented using the Chart.js library, showcasing an interactive bar chart that enables users to monitor current air quality levels in cities like New York, London, and Tokyo. 

The user interface, designed with HTML and CSS, incorporates Unsplash images to emphasize the importance of clean air for public health. By raising awareness and providing accessible information, this project aims to empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions about their health and well-being amidst urbanization challenges.
